The twitch bot/overlay needs to do the following:
-monitor the chat log for keywords
-play sounds on keyword recognition
-display an overlay

The above are the minimal requirements.

Other thoughts are:
-reply to people
-animated overlay
-timers on certain commands/words/iterations

The overlay as I imagine is going to be translucent, scalable and pixel art based.
I've started to create sound files from text to speech. I would also like an explosion sound possibly.

The idea with the explosion sound is when the jar is full it explodes.
